I’m a Yale student majoring in Data Science & Statistics and Environmental Studies, driven by the belief that meaningful impact happens when data meets purpose. My journey began at UWC, where experiential learning and global citizenship shaped my early commitment to education equity and environmental action.

During my gap year, I co-founded a bilingual coding bootcamp for middle school girls in rural China and became a certified nature educator—experiences that taught me to lead with empathy and communicate complex ideas across diverse audiences.

At Yale, I’ve deepened my technical toolkit and applied it to real-world problems—developing AI models for leopard conservation, visualizing geophysical data for carbon sequestration, and analyzing ESG performance for climate strategy. These experiences reflect my transition from advocacy to applied analytics and now to building tools that scale solutions.

Today, I’m exploring career opportunities in data science, software engineering, and climate tech—especially roles that blend technical rigor with systems thinking. I'm particularly interested in projects that empower communities, unlock climate resilience, or drive equity through data. Let’s connect if you’re building something impactful at the intersection of data and sustainability—or if you just want to talk code, climate, or coffee.
